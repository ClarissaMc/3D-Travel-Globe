# 3D-Travel-Globe
Are you a fellow globe-trotter who loves to look back at past travels? Or perhaps you want to bookmark all the places you aspire to vist one day? Well, this 3D Travel Globe has got you covered!

This project allows you to interact with a 3D globe and place markers to visually represent your past, present, and future travel destinations. The marker colors are fully customizable, so you can use different colors to represent the travels of different members of a household or to differentiate between past vacations and those still on your bucket list. You can also input information about each trip, such as the city, duration, purpose, and more! When you click on a placed marker, this information will pop up, letting you relive those fun times! The country is also automatically detected when the marker is placed, so you don't even need to enter it yourself!

To use this tool, all you need to do is visit the GitHub Page: 
To place a marker, click on a country on the globe. 
If you want to input information for a marker, enter it in the GUI on the right-hand side of the screen <b>BEFORE</b> placing the marker! Each field is completely optional. :)
To delete a marker, simply right click it.

This project uses your local storage to seemlessly save your globe for future reference and modifications. If you have trouble saving your data, make sure to check your cookie settings. :)
