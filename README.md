Are you a fellow globe-trotter who loves to look back at past travels? Or perhaps you want to bookmark all the places you aspire to vist one day? Well, this 3D Travel Globe has got you covered!

This project allows you to interact with a 3D globe and place markers to visually represent your past, present, and future travel destinations. Features include:
<ul>
  <li>Fully customizable markers! Use different colors to represent different members of a household or to differentiate between past vacations and those still on your bucket list.</li>
  <li>Information input for each marker</li>
  <li>Automatic country detection, so you don't have to input it yourself.</li>
  <li>Pop-up displays when clicking on markers</li>
  <li>Local storage saving, so you can pick up where you left off any time.</li>
  <li>All of this, right in the comfort of your own browser!</li>
</ul>

To use this app, all you need to do is visit the GitHub Page: <br/>
<ul>
  <li>To place a marker, click on a country on the globe.</li>
  <li>If you want to input information for a marker, enter it in the GUI on the right-hand side of the screen <b>BEFORE</b> placing the marker! Each field is completely optional. :)</li>
  <li>To delete a marker, simply right click it.</li>
</ul>

This project uses your local storage to seemlessly save your globe for future reference and modifications. If you have trouble saving your data, make sure to check your cookie settings. :)
